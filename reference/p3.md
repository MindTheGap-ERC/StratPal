# simulate Poisson point process

Simulates events in the interval `from` to `to` based on a Poisson point
process with rate `rate`. If the parameter `n` is used, the number of
fossils is conditioned to be `n` In the context of paleontology, these
events can be interpreted as fossil occurrences or first/last
occurrences of species. In this case, the rate is the average number of
fossil occurrences (resp first/last occurrences) per unit

## Usage

``` r
p3(rate, from, to, n = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- rate:

  strictly positive number, rate of events (avg events per unit)

- from:

  lowest boundary of observed interval

- to:

  upper boundary of observed interval

- n:

  integer of NULL (default). Number of events to return. If NULL, the
  number is random and determined by the rate parameter

## Value

a numeric vector with timing/location of events.

## See also

[`p3_var_rate()`](https://mindthegap-erc.github.io/StratPal/reference/p3_var_rate.md)
for the variable rate implementation

## Examples

``` r
# for fossil occ.
x = p3(rate = 5, from = 0, to = 1) # 5 fossil occurrences per myr on avg.
hist(x, xlab = "Time (Myr)", ylab = "Fossil Occurrences" )


x = p3(rate = 3, from = 0, to = 4)
hist(x, main = paste0(length(x), " samples")) # no of events is random


x = p3(rate = 3, from = 0, to = 4, n = 10)
hist(x, main = paste0(length(x), " samples")) # no of events is fixed to n

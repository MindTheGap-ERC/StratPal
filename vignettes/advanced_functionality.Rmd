Here we go through how the presented workflows can be generalized and expanded upon.

## Different forward models

In the examples, we used age-depth models from a carbonate platform simulated with CarboCAT lite ([Burgess 2013](#References), [Burgess 2023](#References)). This can easily be expanded to any other sedimentary forward model (be it marine or terrestrial, siliciclastic, mixed, or carbonate system).

For this, age-depth information needs to be extracted from the forward model. The vectors of elapsed model time vs. accumulated height can then be handed over to `tp_to_adm` to define age-depth model objects. These can then be used in the pipelines as in the examples.

If the forward model included erosion, you need to first account for time intervals where sediment is first deposited and later removed. For this, first define a sediment accumulation curve using `admtools::tp_to_sac`, and pass it to `admtools::sac_to_adm` to turn it into an age-depth model. You can then use the resulting age-depth model for your analysis pipeline.

## Empirical age-depth models

Of course you can use empirical age-depth models in your pipeline. You can create them from tie points using `tp_to_adm` just as in the case with forward models.

The workflow in `StratPal` does not work with `multiadm` objects as defined by `admtools`. These objects store multiple age-depth models to account for uncertainty. You can however reduce their complexity, e.g. via `admtools::median_adm`, and use the resulting age-depth model.

## Other ecological gradients and niche definitions

In the examples we used water depth as ecological gradient. The approach for niche modeling used in `StratPal` works for all types of niches and gradient. Potentially relevant gradients that can be extracted from forward models are for example substrate consistency, temperature, or water energy.

We used a simple niche definition based on a probability density function of a normal distribution implemented in `snd_niche`. This can be expanded to arbitrary niche definitions along a gradient. For integration with `apply_niche`, niche definitions must meet the following criteria:

1.  They are functions that take gradient values as input and return numbers between 0 and 1 as outputs.
2.  They are vectorized, meaning when handed a vector, they return a vector of equal length.

Similar criteria hold for the definitions of gradient change `gc`:

1.  `gc` must be a function that takes time (or position) as input, and returns gradient values as outputs.
2.  The function must be vectorized, meaning when handed a vector, it must return a vector of equal length.

As long as these conditions for `gc` and `niche_def` are met, arbitrary niche preferences along any gradient can be modeled using `apply_niche`.

## Different models of phenotypic evolution

Other types of phenotypic evolution in the time domain can easily be incorporated. For seamless integration, they need to meet the following criteria:

-   They take a vector of times as first argument

-   The implementation is for a continuous time version of the mode of interest, as the time domain is generally sampled at irregular times (see methods section in [Hohmann et al. (2024)](#References) for details). More specifically, the implementation must be able to deal with heterodistant sampling in time.

-   They return a list with two elements: One named `t` that is a duplicate of the first argument handed to the function. The second one should be named `y` and contain the simulated trait values.

-   The output list `l` should be assigned both the class "list" and "timelist" via the command `class(l) = c("timelist", "list")` , see the source code of `random_walk` for an example.

The last two points make sure plotting via `admtools::plot.timelist` and `admtools::plot.stratlist` works seamlessly.

## Different models of event type data

We used (constant and variable rate) Poisson point processes to simulate event type data. Any model of event-type data can be used (e.g., one with temporal correlation), as long as it returns a vector with the timing/position of the events.

## Transforming data from the stratigraphic domain to the time domain

Much of the explanations here focus on forward modeling, i.e., modeling the time domain and examining how it is expressed in the stratigraphic domain. The reverse direction (from the stratigraphic domain to the time domain) can be modeled using `strat_to_time`.

## Taphonomy for event type data

Taphonomic effects can be incorporated using using the `apply_taphonomy` function. This is based on the same principle as niche modeling, and makes use of the `thin` function, but was not shown in the examples. For `pres_potential` (resp. `ctc`), the same logical constraints apply as to `niche_def` (resp. `gc`).

## Transform different types of data

`strat_to_time` and `time_to_strat` are generic functions of the `admtools` package that can transform different types of data. Currently they transform phylogenetic trees (`phylo` objects), lists (`list` class), and numeric data such as the event type data (class `numeric`).

In general, any type of temporal (resp. stratigraphic) data can be transformed. For this, you need define a `S3` class for the object you would like to transform (if it does not already have a S3 class), and then implement the transformation of this class for `time_to_strat` and `strat_to_time`.

If you would like to add transformations for new S3 classes to the `admtools` package, please see the contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md file) of the `admtools` package for details on how to contribute code.
